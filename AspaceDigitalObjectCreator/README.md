# ArchivesSpace Digital Object Record Creator Tool
Updated version of the classic GW SCRC Aspace Digital Object Record Creator.

This version allows for users to choice between a user-generated titled for a DO record or to simply inherent a title from the attached archival object record. 

See example.csv for formatting of csv sheet. Blank 'new_title' rows will result in a DO title being pulled from the AO title.

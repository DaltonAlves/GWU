## [Aspace DO Creator Tool](/Aspace%20DO%20Creator%20Tool)
Updated version of the classic SCRC Aspace DO tool. This version has been updated to that allow user to input a title of a DO. User inputted titles are useful for creating multiple DOs attached to an AO. An example of this might be a digitized audiotape with two sides. Or, if a digital object represents a more granular level of description than the related archival object affords.

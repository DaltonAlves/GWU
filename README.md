## [Aspace Digital Object Creator](AspaceDigitalObjectCreator)
Updated version of the classic GW SCRC Aspace Digital Object Record Creator.

This version allows for users to choose between a user-inputted titled for a DO record or to simply inherent a title from the attached archival object record.

## [Aspace_to_InternetArchiveMetadata](Aspace_to_InternetArchiveMetadata)
Repurposes archival description from GWU's ArchivesSpace records to facilitate digital collection metadata creation. Maps metadata from Aspace 'archival object' records (AOs) and their ancestors (resource and other AO records) to required and additional custom fields in the Internet Archive's metadata schema.

Also maps the file extension of a digital object to the required 'mediatype' IA field and its related controlled vocabulary.

## [DigitalAccesioning](DigitalAccesioning)
Examples of simple python scripts, primarly using the OS and hashlib modules, that complete pre-ingest examinations and manipulations of born-digital records.
